# Top-Applicants-by-Country
Produce a list of the most prolific patent applicants per country from an excel list containing the search results of a patent search

A search list, in this example Biotech_comps.xlsx, is obtained from the Orbit patent search engine in which the search options were a list of the most common IPC classifications used in Biotech, restricted to patents filed on or after 2015 and to patent families with more than three members (Usually a priority application a PCT and/or EPO filing and one or more national phases, in this case at least one of those national phases may be an EPO country or an EP patent validated) A further restriction in the search was to show only patents filed or validated in selected EPC countries

The result list was then processed to group the patents by patent applicant country and then produce a ranking of the top 100 applicants with more patents filed in each of the selected countries. The resulting excel presents the data concerning each country in a different Excel sheet.
